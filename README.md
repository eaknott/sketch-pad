This is a project for The Odin Project's Foundations Course:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

The task is to make a simple digital sketch pad or something similar to an Etch-a-Sketch toy by creating an interactive square grid in a webpage. 

This Etch-a-Sketch is to be made using HTMl, CSS, Flexbox, and plain Javascript to manipulate the DOM.
